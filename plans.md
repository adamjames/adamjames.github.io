- The proper use of [DBCC CHECKIDENT(TableName, RESEED)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/472578/dbcc-checkident-sets-identity-to-0).
- Integrating hardware and resources from four seperate machines into a cohesive multi-platform development environment.
- Configuring full-text search under Windows 7.
