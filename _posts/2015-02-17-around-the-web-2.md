I'm starting to realise just how much time I must spend online, reading things. This is starting to seem like a poor man's version of Google Reader, but at least it produces something a bit prettier than throwing it all into an actual database somewhere.

* Jacques Mattheij's blog really is fantastic. He writes great posts that fuse technology, business and career management (among other things) perfectly. Try ["Please Do Not Be a One Trick Pony"][one-trick-pony], ["All Programming Is Bookkeeping"][programming-bookkeeping] and ["All the Technology but None of the Love"][all-tech-no-love] on for size.
* An introduction to [Object-oriented JavaScript for C# developers][oo-js].
* How to [flip the script on technical recruiters][flip-script] and change from a pull to a push model.
* A concise explanation of the [theory and implementation of bunny hopping mechanics][bunny-hopping] in first-person shooters.
* [Jon Gottfried][jon-g] describes a [meteoric][hackathons] experience of hackathons.
* A long-form New York Times [article][yitang-zhang-article]([mirror][yitang-zhang-paste]) covering the work of [Yitang Zhang][yitang-zhang-wiki] on the ["Bound Gaps"][bound-gaps] problem.
* Mahmoud Al-Qudsi describes some interesting (if possibly too complicated for a team of developers not already comfortable with encryption) ways to [reduce code and context storage][avoid-db-writes-with-hmac] using [HMAC][hmac-wiki]'s. It spawned some interesting [discussion][hnews-avoid-db-with-hmac] on Hacker News.
* Jon Fisher explains how to back up your long-term storage [with Amazon Glacier][glacier-backups].
* Github user [peenuty][github-peenuty] tries to calculate [the carbon footprint of mining Bitcoin][carbon-bitcoin].
