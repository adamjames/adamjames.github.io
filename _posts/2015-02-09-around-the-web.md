Interesting links and things I've seen and read over the last week (more or less):

* [Crunchbang Linux][crunchbanglinux] closes its' doors. Luckily there's still [Archbang][archbanglinux]. Thanks for the awesome distro [@corenominal][core-nominal], best of luck to you in your future endeavours!
* [GnuPG][gnupg-donations] was running out of money, but the community rallied behind the project, with individual contributions raising [over €120,000][gnupg-donations-after], not including large donations from the Linux Foundation, payments processor Stripe and Facebook.
* The courts ruled that British intelligence agency GHCQ's "full take" (i.e. metadata and *all* traffic) collection of all data transiting the UK was unlawful for seven years.
* The Electronic Frontier Foundation has [won its four-year Freedom of Information Act lawsuit][eff-legal-basis-for-spying] over secret legal interpretations of a controversial section of the Patriot Act, including legal analysis of law enforcement and intelligence agency access to census records.
* The U.S. Department of Justice apparently thinks 80% of *traffic* on the [Tor network][doj-tor-traffic] is child pornography. I don't even know what to think.
* [Radim Řehůřek][radim] takes us on a guided introduction to [data science in Python][python-data-science].
* [Warren Henning][warren-henning] encourages us to go on an adventure and [learn mathematics][adventures-in-mathematics].
* Commits.io - your code is beautiful, but most people will never see it... why not [turn it into a poster][commits-io]?
* In ["Talking to Pluto is hard"][talking-to-pluto], Emily Lakdawalla explains in detail some of the challenges in getting data back from space.
* The C2 Programming Wiki had something of a [redesign][c2-redesign], which you can see [here][c2-new]. Original seems to still be [available][c2-original]. Archive [here][c2-archive].
* A concise example of how [same-page postbacks][aspnet-postback] work(ed?) in ASP.NET. Some of us are still working with ASP.NET 2!
* I came across some databinding expressions I didn't recognise, so here's a [list][aspnet-databinding]. I'd like to know the use case for being able to databind at all those different points in the pages' lifecycle. That said, with the next version it'll probably all change yet again. [Open-source ASP.NET with Linux and OSX support][aspnet-five-on-docker] is a killer feature though.
* Scott Hanselman's second list of [.NET Interview Questions][dotnet-interviewquestions]. Great for a refresher, I'm happy to say I could take a reasonable stab at about 60% of this list at the moment.
* Another Hanselman post, this time on static analysis with [NDepend][hanselman-ndepend].
* The notes from the first design meeting for C# 7 have been made available on [Github][c-sharp-design-notes]! 
* Does your code pass [The Turkey Test][turkey-test]? It's pretty much a gold standard test-case for software internationalisation. Don't forget that [working with dates and times is fraught with danger][nodatime-blog], too.
* A software bug a decade in the making - the mysterious case of the [disappearing Polish Ś][polish-s-bug].
* [NVIDIA G-SYNC][nvidia-gsync] code in an alpha display driver for an AdaptiveSync-capable display reveals some interesting goings-on.
* [Oracle v. Google][oracle-v-google] could go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court after Google petitioned it to overturn a previous appeals court ruling favoring Oracle Corporation.
* Facebook just taught us all [how to build websites][facebook] (again.)
* The open-plan office and the [extrovert ideal][extroverts]. [Matt][matt-blodgett] writes some very interesting posts!
* Does your team respect the build? [They will][siren-of-shame].
* [NimbleText][nimble] is a great little editor with some nicely integrated expression evaluation. It's exceptionally good at certain tasks, like writing schema modification scripts for databases.

More next week as time allows :)
